        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm <span id="name">Dagmawi Dessalegn</span>, a resilient and positive individual with a passion for technology and a zest for life. Born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery early on.
            
            I attended Gibson Youth Academy, a prestigious US-based educational institution in Ethiopia, where I honed my academic skills and developed a deep curiosity for technology. During my junior year in high school, I ventured into the professional world as an Operations lead assistant for a prominent medical importer and distributor company. Through adaptability and determination, I swiftly transitioned into the role of an associate software engineer within the same company.
            
            Driven by a desire for knowledge and growth, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Simulation and Modeling Engineering at Old Dominion University in the United States. Currently a permanent resident in the process of naturalization, I am eager to contribute my skills and experiences to the dynamic world of technology.</p>

    <div class="objective">
        <h3> Objective</h3>
        <p> I'm fueled by a passion for innovation and a relentless drive for excellence.
            
            My goal is to harness my diverse academic background, hands-on software development experience, and advanced coursework in simulation and modeling engineering to thrive in a challenging role within the technology sector. With a Bachelor's degree in Simulation and Modeling Engineering, along with a minor in Computer Science, and currently pursuing an accelerated Master's program in the same field, I bring a robust skill set and an insatiable thirst for knowledge.
         My aim is clear: to apply my expertise to tackle real-world challenges, pioneer cutting-edge simulation solutions, and contribute to projects that redefine the boundaries of technology. I've honed my skills through practical experience in both front-end and back-end software development. Whether it's crafting visually captivating user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or building robust server-side applications with Python, Java, and C++, I thrive on turning ideas into reality.
         Moreover, my coursework in machine learning, parallel programming, and systemic decision-making has equipped me with advanced capabilities crucial for the simulation and modeling engineering domain. I'm particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to fuse machine learning algorithms into simulation models, optimize performance using parallel programming techniques, and drive strategic decision-making through systemic analysis.
         In addition to my technical prowess, my strong interpersonal skills enable me to thrive in collaborative environments. I excel in communicating complex ideas effectively, building strong relationships with team members, and fostering a culture of trust and collaboration. In my quest to make a tangible impact, I seek to join an innovative organization dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology and fostering collaboration. I'm eager to immerse myself in a dynamic environment where continuous learning, growth, and contribution are not just encouraged but celebrated. Together, let's embark on a journey to shape the future of simulation and modeling engineering.
